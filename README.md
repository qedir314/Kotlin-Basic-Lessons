- Differences between `Set` and `List`

## Control Flow

This section covers Kotlin's control flow mechanisms, including:

- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- `when` expressions

## Functions

Learn how to define and use functions in Kotlin:

- Declaring functions
